# IllEngine

In this class you will make your own game engine from scratch.

## Platform setup

The first thing we need is a compiler and build system. In this class, we will use [`xmake`](https://xmake.io/) as our build system.
`xmake` is simple, modern, cross-platform, and comes with a package manager.
There are [installation instructions](https://xmake.io/#/guide/installation) for many platforms.
On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install xmake`.
On Windows, you can use `winget` (or other options): `winget install xmake`.
On Linux, there are instructions for various flavors.

You also need a compiler.
On macOS, you should install `Xcode` with the `App Store`.
On Windows, install Visual Studio.
On Linux, install gcc or clang.

One you have a compiler and `xmake` installed, we are ready to begin.

## Making a project

Create a new directory. Since we're making a "little engine", I called mine `illengine` (ðŸ¤·).
Create a file `xmake.lua` and put the following inside:

```
add_rules("mode.debug", "mode.release")

target("helloworld")
    set_kind("binary")
    set_languages("cxx17")
    
    add_files("demo/helloworld.cpp")
```

This declares that we want to support debug and release builds in general.
It also declares a target program named `helloworld`.
(It would have declared a library if instead of `binary` we had written `static` or `shared`.)
We want to use the C++17 standard.
This Hello, World! program will verify that your environment is working correctly.
Let's put the program in a `demo` directory. Create `demo/helloworld.cpp` and put the most basic C++ program inside:

```
#include <iostream>

int main( int argc, const char* argv[] ) {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

Then type `xmake` on the command line. Unless something has gone wrong, you should see something like:

```
[ 25%]: ccache compiling.release demo/helloworld.cpp
[ 50%]: linking.release helloworld
[100%]: build ok!
```

`xmake` puts the resulting program (`binary`) somewhere inside a new directory it creates (and manages) named `build`. You can run it directly (for me, it's `./build/macosx/arm64/release/helloworld`). It's easier to just ask `xmake` to run it for you with `xmake run helloworld`. This will print:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Setting up version control

Before going any further, let's set up version control with git. You can use git on the command line or using your favorite git gui. Before we proceed with git, we need to create a `.gitignore` file at the top level of our project directory so we don't add build products or other extraneous files to our git repository. Put this inside:

```
# Xmake
/build
/.xmake

# macOS
.DS_Store
# Windows
Thumbs.db
```

Now you should initialize your git repository and make a first commit.
